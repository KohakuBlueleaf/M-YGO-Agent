# YGO Agent

YGO Agent is a project to create a Yu-Gi-Oh! AI using deep learning (LLMs, RL). It consists of a game environment and a set of AI agents.

## ygoenv
`ygoenv` is a high performance game environment for Yu-Gi-Oh! It is initially inspired by [yugioh-ai](https://github.com/melvinzhang/yugioh-ai]) and [yugioh-game](https://github.com/tspivey/yugioh-game), and now implemented on top of [envpool](https://github.com/sail-sg/envpool).

## ygoai
`ygoai` is a set of AI agents for playing Yu-Gi-Oh! It aims to achieve superhuman performance like AlphaGo and AlphaZero, with or without human knowledge. Currently, we focus on using reinforcement learning to train the agents.
